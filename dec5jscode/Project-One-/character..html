	<h1 style="text-align: center">The 7 Sisters: characters</h1>
	<div id=accordion>
		<h2 style="color: red;">Sydney Larson</h2>
		 <p>This fiery redhead may seem like a hothead (figuratively, speaking) but she is actually quite nice, and the voice reason in her gang. Her powers include many different variants of pyrokenesis</p>
		<h2 style="color: orange;">Andrea Amante</h2>
		<p>A bit standoffish and undoubtly immature; This tall woman appears to be something of a loose cannon. But like almost all the girls in the gang, there's more to her than what's on the surface.</p>
		<h2 style="color: yellow;">Mac Bellfree</h2>
		<p>If I were to tell you that some members of the gang were the embodiment of joy. Would you buy it?
		Well the same can be said Mackenzie Bellfree!</p>
		<h2 style="color: green;">Madison Valeg</h2>
		<p>Small in stature, but quick, and light, on her feet. this little of joy is the little bit glue this keeps the gang together. kinda like Mr poopybutthole (<em>Rick and Morty</em>)</p>
		<h2 style="color: blue;">Maria Ford</h2>
		<p>One of the last original members, Maria seems pretty silent most of the time....very few know why</p>
		<h2 style="color: purple">Mars folk</h2>
		<p>A slender, well educated literal mother. Mars is without a doubt the smartest member of the gang. Sadly this makes her a target to most villains</p>
		<h2 style="color: pink">Stephanie Guiness</h2>
		<p></p>
